## How to contribute to Flask App 2

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in this app**. Instead, refer to our security policy, which will be posted shortly.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/beebus/flask-app-2/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/beebus/flask-app-2/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .py file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:
  * [**Active Record** (models, database) issues](https://github.com/beebus/flask-app-2/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/active_record_master.py)
  * [**Action Pack** (controllers, routing) issues](https://github.com/beebus/flask-app-2/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/action_controller_master.py)
  * [**Generic template** for other issues](https://github.com/beebus/flask-app-2/blob/master/guides/bug_report_templates/generic_master.py)

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please familiarize yourself with standard Python and Flask coding conventions. I suggest either working through a [Flask tutorial video](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-flask-2) or reading a book on Flask, such as "Flask Web Development: Developing Web Applications with Python" by Miguel Grinberg. ISBN: 978-1-449-37262-0. It is available on both Amazon.com and O'Reilly, but it's possible your local library has it.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the Flask app may or may not be accepted, but in generally, it will be safe to assume they will not be accepted.

#### **Do you want to contribute to this particular Flask app documentation?**

This repo is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and possibly join our team where we can teach and learn from each other how to do more with Flask and other technologies.

Thanks! :smile: :smile: :smile:
